# "Adjudicating Sartorial Elegance from the Court": My new article on the sumptuary impulse of  anti-ambush marketing law in the latest issue of QMJIP

**Abstract**: Ambush marketing, sometimes also known as guerrilla marketing, comprises attempts to create an unauthorized association with mega-sporting  events (such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup) without  obtaining official sponsorship agreements. This article contends that  the contemporary law of sports sponsorships against ambush marketing  harbours a palpable but much-neglected sumptuary impulse, which has  never before been adequately scrutinized. It shows that pre-modern  sumptuary law strangely resonates with modern anti-ambush law's  sumptuary obsession with the visual order of symbols and images as  prestige signifiers. It also reveals an ongoing ‘intellectual property’  turn in the recent development of sumptuary anti-ambush law-making,  whose ambition is to reify sports-derived sumptuary distinction into a  thing-in-itself for nearly absolute ‘property’ protection. My argument  is illustrated by a carefully selected number of ambush disputes  including *Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) v Telstra*, which represents the latest development in this field of law.
